I created a Website for my Front-end career path

I added my past projects, the ones that are my ideas and the ones inspired by assignments, tasks and projects done at Stutern

I have the home section, which introduces the website to a viewer
I have an about section that shows my level of proficiency in different libraries and frameworks of software development.
I have a projects section that shows my projects, the websites/projects I have built over time.
I have the Contact Me section, which lists different social media accounts on which I can be contacted.
Of course, I have the Header and the Footer section.

Thank You.
